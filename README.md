# Compilation

You will need **Visual studio 2019** and Visual C++ SDK installed.

Download the .zip folder from releases, extract it to a folder `e.g: MyProjectFolder`
Next, open the .sln file and once loaded go to the `Source.cpp` file, then find the webhook link
inside of the sprintf call and change it to desired link.

**Make sure you are using "Release" not "Debug" when compiling!**

Press ctrl + b and enjoy!
