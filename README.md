# CLEO

![Cleo image](images/cleo.png)

A C++ token grabber that anyone can use, please do not "paste" or steal this code
because you will regret it. The whole point of this is learning. If I didn't want to
learn I could easily just grab a Python token grabber and use py2exe on it.

## Pros
     - Silence and persistence
     - Supports the latest discord updates
     - Grabs Lightcord and Discord
     - Fast, Its made in C++  
## Cons
     - Does not support early windows versions
     - Hard to understand for beginners in programming

**Gladly, the pros outweigh the cons.**
